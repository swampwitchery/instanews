#Instanews project
This is the second project for the Web Development Program at RED Academy,
where we implimented jQuery, with use of AJAX. 
this is a project to showcase HTML and CSS to build a responsive website
as part of the Web Development Program at RED Academy. This was the first project
completed and my first time utilizing various forms of code. Adapting a
carousel/flickity proved to be difficult. The result was to build a responsive
website to look like a front of an online clothing store with the skills
learned within two weeks.
